# Pedestrian_detection
It detects any pedestrian coming in front of the camera using YOLO (You Only Look Once). YOLO is a network used to detect objects. 
It is a single network similar to CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that takes an image frame as an input and outputs a vector of bounding
boxes and class predictions. YOLO is customized to detect only one object that is a person, who in turn is a pedestrian.

Once you start running the code, the camera starts running and image frames are extracted from the on-going video. 
Download the pre-trained YOLO v3 weights file from the link ( https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights ) and place it in the current
directory or you can directly download to the current directory in terminal using

$ wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
